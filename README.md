# Windows Performance Recorder

This repository contains a single PowerShell script "Start-WprCapture.ps1", which can be used to collect detailed debugging information about the operating system using the [![Windows Performance Recorder utility](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/windows-performance-recorder)]. More specifically, the script runs WPR to capture CPU utilization, Disk I/O activity, File I/O activity, Registry activity, Network activity, and Mini-Filter Driver activity for 1 minute. WPR saves the generated event trace log file (.etl) in the folder specified by the "WprFolderPath" parameter.
